# phd-thesis-rmarkdown

In this repo, I provide all `Rmarkdown` files that I use to build my Ph.D. thesis at IIM Bangalore. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Rmarkdown and hence sharing it publicly for others to use and improve.

The final version of the manuscript is present in file **`jof_paper.pdf`**
